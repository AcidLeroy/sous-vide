# Sous Vide Raspberry Pi Project

This project is a simple raspberry pi project that uses a postgres database as the device "shadow". The idea is to have persistent
storage of intermediate results for tuning purposes for when (eventually) I'll put a PID in. There are obviously several
other projects that do exactly what I am doing just in a slightly different way. Eventually I would like to connect 
a web interface to this project as well so I can easily plot historical data.
